### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

Box sizing, responsive page.

```html
<div class="text-content">
  <h1>Order Summary</h1>
  <p>
    You can now listen to millions of songs, audiobooks, and podcast on any
    device anywhere you like.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
.text-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin-top: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

Continue to develop more project about HTML and CSS, hope that in the future can do with JavaScript too.
